# Unit 3 - Data for Social Good Project 

## Introduction 

Software engineers develop programs to work with data and provide information to a user. Each user has different needs based on the information they are looking for from data. Your goal is to create a data analysis program for your user that stores and analyzes data to provide the information they need. 

## Requirements 

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, one-dimensional (1D) arrays, and algorithms to create your data analysis program: 
- **Write a class** – Write a class to represent your user or business and store and analyze their data with no-argument and parameterized constructors. 
- **Create at least two 1D arrays** – Create at least two 1D arrays to store the data that your user needs information about. 
- **Write a method** – Write a method that finds or manipulates the elements in a 1D array to provide the information your user needs. 
- **Implement a toString() method** – Write a toString() method that returns general information about the data (for example, number of values in the dataset). 
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions. 

## User Story 

Include your User Story you analyzed for your project here. Your User Story should have the following format: 

> As a [traveler], <br> 
> I want to [know the time and price of local flights], <br> 
> so that I can [know the cheapest and most expensive flights]. 

## Dataset 

Include a hyperlink to the source of your dataset used for this project. Additionally, provide a short description of each column used from the dataset, and the data type. 

Example: 

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dilwong/flightprices/data
- **Departure** (String) - the departure airport
- **Arrival** (String) - the arrival airport
- **Time** (int) - time of the flight 
- **Price** (double) - price of the flight

## Description 

Travelers are interested in finding detailed information about local flights, including the departure times and ticket prices. With these information will allow the user to compare and decide which flights are the most affordable for them. By understanding the prices, the user can make decisions about when to travel and which flights best fit their budget. The Dataset we chose for this project was the Flight Prices dataset. This dataset provides essential information about the flight schedules and pricing. The dataset includes the departure and arrival airports column. It also provides information about the time intervals for each flight, helping the user understand the scheduling of flights. Lastly, the dataset contains a column with the prices for each flight, which the user can identify pricing across different routes and times. These information will help the user plan their trips and manage their travel expenses effectively.
